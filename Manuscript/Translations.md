# Translations

## How to add translations

1. Use the arrow_right emoji for direct translations (copy from examples below).

2. Add a `arrow_down` emoji afterwards if translating from a proper noun (like `Floating Fortress`) to a not-proper noun (like `aircraft carrier`).

- [ ]

## How this file works

1. ➡️ Use the `arrow_right` emoji for direct translations.
2. Add a warning on right  if translating from an uppercase beginning to a lowercase beginning so that it can be uppercased at beginnings of sentences.
3. Translations happen in order.
