## Translator notes (BEFORE START OF BOOK)

William Entriken, 2021

The original book Nineteen Eighty-Four was published in 1949 by clairvoyant George Orwell. This book accurately predicted world affairs, social stratification in the West, and a surveillance culture that would come decades later. In order to make this seminal book more accessible to the next generation of readers, I have undertaken to translate the text into English. Since the source text is also in English perhaps this requires an explanation.

George Orwell died in 1950, long before personal computers were invented, the United States left the gold standard, Sputnik launched into space, HIV/AIDS was discovered, and smoking was found to cause cancer. The vocabulary available to Orwell was limited to communicate all his ideas. I have taken to updating names that have changed, e.g. Persia is now Iran. In places where Orwell is clearly referring to The 99% (which started from the 2011 Occupy movement), I simply substitute in "The 99%". But I do not change Orwell's voice. Also, Orwell did not fully understand how all our modern technology works, and this explains why one character in the book crushed her hand accidentally using computer software. He refers to Siri (the digital assistant that helps you dictate messages) as "the Siri". When Orwell is writing about The Cloud (i.e. where all of your email is stored, every photo you have taken in the past ten years, and nearly everything that is knowable about you) he sometimes refers to The Cloud with the male pronoun ("he"/"him") and treats it like a human. This personification of The Cloud is preserved along with Orwell's other oddities in the ways he describes new technology.

If you have ever read about clairvoyance or time travel before you know there is a risk that knowledge of the future could cause people to make different choices to avoid that future. Instead, Nineteen Eighty-Four is seen by many today as a playbook for mass surveillance by the powers that be. But still one company that is mostly responsible for the world's surveillance apparatus has specifically told the public how it wants to avoid the future portrayed in Nineteen Eighty-Four, and they have intentionally named their products differently than in the book. I have updated these words in the text so you can see exactly when Orwell was referring to the iPhone and other specific products that turned out to have a different name. Even in the present year you can see this company distancing itself from Nineteen Eighty-Four and its critics showing how they created the reality predicted in Nineteen Eighty-Four.

Lastly, there are certain places where Orwell was simply incorrect. My translation is mostly literal so you can judge for yourself where Orwell was correct and where he had failed to predict the future. Every change versus Orwell's original text is shown in <u>underline</u>. In one place Orwell talks about London after Brexit and how the city is making concerted preparations for the United States presidential elections. So it would appear that Orwell did not fully understand the implications of Brexit. On the other hand, given Orwell's track record for everything else in the book, it is also possible that I do not fully understand the implications of Brexit.

## End note

William Entriken, 2021

George Orwell died in 1950 and his legacy includes this story, his other great novels and papers, and the foundation and prizes in his name. As time goes on, we only learn further how right he was.

As time unfolds, the powers that be will tell you how a future with them "won't be like '1984'". And they will continue to invent new words to obscure the outcomes that Orwell clearly saw coming.

I plan to release a new version of this book to include these new words and hashtags.

## (Extra text inside Appendix)

(Add right after "It would have been quite impossible... absolute government.")

(And use underline!)

Not every text of the past becomes succinct when updated. For example, the simple old text "The United States Government will allocate a sum, equal to half the country's entire annual output, so that CEOs will have stock bonuses this year" would be updated as:

> The Federal Reserve is committed to use its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time and thereby promote its maximum employment and price stability goals.
>
> The Federal Open Market Committee is taking further actions to support the flow of credit to households and businesses by addressing strains in the markets for Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. The Federal Reserve will continue to purchase Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions. The Committee will include purchases of agency commercial mortgage-backed securities in its agency mortgage-backed security purchases. In addition, the Open Market Desk will continue to offer large-scale overnight and term repurchase agreement operations. The Committee will continue to closely monitor market conditions, and will assess the appropriate pace of its securities purchases at future meetings.

## Description / synopsis

*Nineteen Eighteen-Five* translated by William Entriken is a modern printing of the classic George Orwell book. Orwell's protagonist battles with his own incriminating **#searchhistory**, the prying eye of the **Social Justice Warriors** watching him through his **smart device**, and is ultimately denounced by the **Two-Party System** after his **Enhanced Interrogations** in **#GITMO**. Throughout his search for the meaning of **White Privilege**, he wonders if **Julian Assange** and **Wikileaks** are real or just another instrument of control by **The 1%**. Meanwhile **The 99%** watches as their language is decimated by **hashtags** and **#mansplaining**, hoping they can avoid being **#canceled**.

## About the translator

The book Nineteen Eighty-Four is very dear to me. I have experience working at Google and inside the United States Department of Defense and I see today's world as large powerful institutions controlling the public. In the same way that my dad tells me how Star Trek influenced science and the gadgetry that we use today, I see Orwell's book as the playbook for the oppressive powers that be. More than a playbook, it manifested the future. I have undertaken to translate this book, into what we now call English.
