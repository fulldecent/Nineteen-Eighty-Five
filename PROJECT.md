The book is sized 6 x 9 with Optima font at 11 point and a 14 point line spacing, with an extra 6 points separating paragraphs; I have 363 pages total. I can adjust that some by changing around the margins and gutter, but if I keep those static and just adjust the font, I can drastically change the page count.

## ‚ùº Pitch to literary agent :x:FAIL

### Notes about pitches:

* She recommends that you read blurbs of books in a similar genre to your work and use them as inspiration for your cover letter. 
* Review by other local writers for feedback https://www.meetup.com/writers-362/

### Specific agents to pitch:

I've looked through hundreds of agents, these have a specific reason why I wanted to pitch.

> Thank you for the encouragement and for keeping this moving quickly. Understood. The battle continues!

  - !! HANDLES ORWELL ESTATE https://members.jerichowriters.com/agentmatch/literary-agent/bill-hamilton/

  - I joined A.M.Heath in 1983 having been brought up amongst many of the agency‚Äôs writers. I‚Äôve been proud to continue a great tradition at A.M.Heath spanning the estate of George Orwell to the international phenomenon that Hilary Mantel has become. I love great storytelling, great writing, great history, and almost any mixture of these in both fiction and non-fiction. It‚Äôs all about fostering talent for as long as it takes, and embracing a constantly changing marketplace. I‚Äôm also privileged to represent many outstanding American writers of fiction and non-fiction across the spectrum, through our alliances in New York.
