:warning: UK store does not show my book

https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/contact-us // Manage your book // Republish



According to my "Bookshelf" at https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/ my paperback book has been listed as "LIVE" for almost 30 days.

ASIN/ISBN: B091DWSM5J

However, when I click the VIEW ON AMAZON link on that page (and then a specific Amazon store) the result is PAGE NOT FOUND. For example, here is what I see when I click the UK store, which is a store I have marked to publish this book in.

https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B091DWSM5J

Please help to correct this so my book actually can be for sale in the UK store, and others.

      > Nineteen Eighty-Five is a modern reprint of the literary classic Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell. This edition differs from the original work (which ended copyright in most countries) by including:
      >
      > - Introduction by the "translator" William Entriken
      > - Modernized wording (e.g. Big Brother➡️The Cloud, Emmanuel Goldstein➡️Julian Assange, The Party➡️White Privilege), over 1,800 changes
      >
      > Orwell's protagonist, Winston Smith, battles with his own incriminating #searchhistory, the prying eye of the Social Justice Warriors watching him through his smart device, and is ultimately denounced by the Two-Party System after his Enhanced Interrogations in #GITMO. Throughout his search for the meaning of White Privilege, he wonders if Julian Assange and Wikileaks are real or just another instrument of control by The 1%. Meanwhile The 99% watches as their language is decimated by hashtags and #mansplaining, hoping they can avoid being #canceled.

> ## Publishing Public Domain Content
>
> Our program allows the selling of content that is in the public domain. However, we may ask you to provide proof that the content you submitted is in the public domain. We may refuse public domain content that's already available through our program or other retail sites. To provide a better customer experience, we don't publish undifferentiated versions of public domain titles if a free version is available in our store. Differentiated works are **unique**. They meet one or more of these requirements:
>
> 
>
> - **Translated**: Unique translations
> - **Annotated**: Unique annotations (additional content like study guides, literary critiques, detailed biographies, or historical context)
> - **Illustrated**: 10 or more unique illustrations relevant to the book
>
>
> Books that meet these requirements must include (Translated), (Annotated), or (Illustrated) in the title field. For example, "Pride and Prejudice (Annotated)" is acceptable; "Pride and Prejudice (with an Introduction by Tiffany Gordon)" is not. The product description must also include a summary of how the book is unique in bullet point format at the beginning of the product description (maximum 80 characters).
>
> It's possible that other features make books unique. However, we only consider public domain titles that meet the requirements listed above to be differentiated. Examples of features we don't consider to be differentiated include:
>
> 
>
> - A linked table of contents
> - Formatting improvements
> - Collections
> - Sales rank
> - Price
> - Freely available Internet content
