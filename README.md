# Nineteen Eighty-Five

This repository includes a Perl script with extensive "find and replaces" that translates George Orwell's classic book *Nineteen Eighty-Four* to use modern words we now use.

* telescreen :arrow_right: smart device
* the Inner Party :arrow_right: The 1%
* newspeak :arrow_right: hashtags
  * Actually Orwell's [entire newspeak dictionary](Manuscript/Translations.md) is appropriately translated to hashtags
* Thought Police :arrow_right: Social Justice Warriors
* 1984 :arrow_right: [ The current year ]
* Hundreds of [other translations](Manuscript/Translations.md)

It resulting book, which is still much in Orwell's voice, sounds much more like non-fiction with the words modernized.

![Cover](./Cover.png)

A novel by William Entriken, based on the public domain work of George Orwell with a similar name. This book shows that George Orwell was right all along—he accurately predicted our future, only his word usage needs to be corrected for us to see it.

### Synopsis

*Nineteen Eighteen-Five* translated by William Entriken is a modern printing of the classic George Orwell book. Orwell's protagonist battles with his own incriminating **#searchhistory**, the prying eye of the **Social Justice Warriors** watching him through his **smart device**, and is ultimately denounced by the **Two-Party System** after his **Enhanced Interrogations** in **#GITMO**. Throughout his search for the meaning of **White Privilege**, he wonders if **Julian Assange** and **Wikileaks** are real or just another instrument of control by **The 1%**. Meanwhile **The 99%** watches as their language is decimated by **hashtags** and **#mansplaining**, hoping they can avoid being **#canceled**.
