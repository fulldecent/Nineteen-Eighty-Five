# Nineteen Eighty-Five

A novel by William Entriken, based on the public domain work of George Orwell with a similar name. This book shows that George Orwell was right all along—he accurately predicted our future, only his word usage needs to be corrected for us to see it.

## Synopsis

*Nineteen Eighteen-Five* translated by William Entriken is a modern printing of the classic George Orwell book. Orwell's protagonist battles with his own incriminating **#searchhistory**, the prying eye of the **Social Justice Warriors** watching him through his **smart device**, and is ultimately denounced by the **Two-Party System** after his **Enhanced Interrogations** in **#GITMO**. Throughout his search for the meaning of **White Privilege**, he wonders if **Julian Assange** and **Wikileaks** are real or just another instrument of control by **The 1%**. Meanwhile **The 99%** watches as their language is decimated by **hashtags** and **#mansplaining**, hoping they can avoid being **#canceled**.
